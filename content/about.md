I worked in education before returning to school to persue a degree in computer science. I am a beginner engineer about to graduate and I am ready to begin a new career in software engineering. I am a passionate worker and proven leader with excellent time/project/priority management skills. I am a capable learner who can not only rapidly close any knowledge gap, but I enjoy teaching others as well. My anticipated graduation is December of 2021.
