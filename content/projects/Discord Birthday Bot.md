## Description

I use discord frequently to talk to friends while we hang out or play video games. I am pretty bad about remembering their birthdays, so I decided to create a discord bot where each person in 
the server can add their birthday. The bot tracks birthdays, changes roles of users temporarily, and posts to a text channel telling the user "happy birthday" so everyone can celebrate with them.
The bot is just a quick dive into the discord library and all the things that it allows users to do as far as creating custom bots that can do a variety of things. I used creating and editting this
bot as a exercise in python script writing as well as some practice with common data structures. It's a work in progress as of right now.
