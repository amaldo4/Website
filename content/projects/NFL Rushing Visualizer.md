## Description

I love sports. Across all major sports, how data is used to dictate gamescripts has drastically changed in the past few years. From NBA players taking way more threes than twos, to the fact that
NFL teams are incredibly more likely to go for it on fourth down than ever before. This year I wanted to use a couple tools to help me with my fantasy football team. Using matplotlib and pandas
I wrote a simple python program that will pull rushing data from nflfastpy, take the data to populate some frames, then create a visualization that displays what areas of the field popular RBs are
receiving their work. While it was a great project to learn some basics about data analysis and the power of python for data science, it has not helped my fantasy team at all.
